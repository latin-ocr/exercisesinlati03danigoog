14. 1. Pray how long, Catiline, shall you abuse our
patience? Your plana ¹are all exposed. The consuls
hold your whole conspiracy ²in their grasp. They know
what plans you adopt. The senate, 100,3 knows all these
things, and yet you are alive. Alive? Nay more, you
have come into the senate, plotting our destruction, and
eager to lay waste the whole earth with fire and slaugh-
ter.

2. Once a mischievous citizen was slain by the Ponti·
fex Maximus, but we, consuls, who have a decree 01 the
senate against you, allow you 10 live. ⁴For twenty days ·
already the decree has been shut up in the recorda, 'like
a sword buried in its sheath, and yet you do not abandon
your ⁶audacious schemes.

3. Idesire ⁷t0 be merciful, but Ι do condemn myself
1018 inactivity and negligence. You ought to have been
put 10 death long ag03 but for a particular reason 1 have
not yet ordered that to be done. Iwish you 10 live as
long as there is⁹ any one who ventures 1ο defend you.

4. But, believe me, many men are watching you,
1⁰although you know it not, and not even a private house
can keep withinll its walls the voice of your conspiracy.
You arc ¹²beset on every hand. Hemmed in by my guards,
you cannot ¹³take a step against the l‘public interest. You
can do nothing that I do not immediately find out.
