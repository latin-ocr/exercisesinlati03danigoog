not believe what Ι reported, 110 one ¹⁰to defend Catiline.
Ι 11oould wish indeed that all his booneompanions, swin-
dlers, poisoners, assassins‚ parricideS, had followed him. s

32. 1. But lthere are some who ask ²whether I drove
Catiline into exile or not. These men 10 not know,I
suppose, that when 116 oame into the senate yesterday
not one senator greeted him, hut everybody³ regarded⁴
him as a most eruel enemy. They have not heard that
Ι disolosed to the senate his whole plan 01 warfare.

war, that he has sent to the oamp 01 Manlius arms and
military standardS, anderen his silver eagle? These
who make thrs assertion‚ who believe that he is an inno
eent man, and Ι a oruel⁷ tyrant, that banish men hy
threats and 10106, are attempting to raise⁸ a storm 01

Catiline has gone into exile at¹⁰ Massilia, say 11 he should

and war? What if he should within three days eom-
11611 an army 01 the enemy? What if he should prefer
to he killed 11111 partisan warfare rather¹² than live 111
exile?
