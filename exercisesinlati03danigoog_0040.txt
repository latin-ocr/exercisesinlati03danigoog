you would be taking too much upon yourselves 8. If the
immortal gods had not 1⁰deprived these men 01 all disere·

CHAPTER X.

43. 1. Wherefore, fellowcitizens sinoe¹ you have been
snatohed from a most erue] death, celebrate the days 01
thanksgiviug. 2. For recall all the just honors that have
been rendered² to the immortal gods. 3. Do you not
yourselves remember the dissensione 01 Marius and
Sulla? 4. I remember that, when Octavius was consul,
this place ⁸was filled4 with heaps of corpses, and flowed⁴
with the blood of citizens 5. ⁵0f all these dissensione,
some tended to the destruction and some to the altera
tion 01 the 6101111 01 government. 6. ⁷There is no need 01
saying that Sulla avenged the cruelty 01 Marius⁷s victory
with great loss to the state. 7. And yet those men were
not ⁸of the kind to desire a restoration 01 harmony, but
the extermination 01 citizens 8. In this war, the most
crue] within⁹ the memory of man, you have been saved
without any bloodshed. 9. All ¹⁰whose safety is iden-
tified with that 01 the eity are regarded as¹¹ enemies.

10. Only¹² so much 01 the city as the flames cannot reaoh
will be saved

CHAPTER XI.

44. 1. For these important¹ services I require from
you ²nothing but the everlasting memory 01 this day.
