those men who 11011110 learning 1may be relied upon.

3. We extol with praises those 111011 whose 310110115 deeds

¹ 11010 been ⁴the therire 01 history. 4. It is certain that

5natural ability without learning has often been effeetual
6111 gaining glory. 5. Some one will ask: “What? Does
learning without natural ability have muoh⁷ weight?”
6. Do we seek pleasure alone from these pursuits?
7. The relaxation ⁸afforded by these studies is ⁹edapted

enthusiasm that is almost divine. 8. Why should we
1105 admire a poet ¹¹wh0 has attained the glory 01 the
writers 01 old? 9. Shall I not deiend Archias in every
way? 10. Does he not seem to be commended to us
by some gift and endowment 01 the gods themselves?
11. Are not you, gentlemen 01 the jury, who are listen-
ing to me 50 01500511011, moved hythe 10100 01 poets?
