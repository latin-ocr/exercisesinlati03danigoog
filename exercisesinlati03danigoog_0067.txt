CHAPTERS X.-XII.

77. 1. Alexander the Great had with him many histo-
rians 01 his exploitS, for he knew that, if he had no one
¹to be the herald 01 his valor, his name ²would be buried
in the same tomb that ³should cover his body. And so
our own “Magnus '² awarded a prizc 10 the historiari 01
his achievements, Theophanes 01 Mytilene. His sol-
diers, too, as if they ⁴had a share in his glory, approved
the act.

2. When Sulla was in Spain, he bestowed citizenship

upon many of the Spaniards3 and would he have rejected
Archias, ⁵if he had sought his favor? He who was so
sager “to have his actions celebrated in verse that 110
10111 an ear to the poor poets 01 Cordova, would not, Ι
suppose, have sought for the genius and ability⁷ 01
Archias.
Ι 3. It must be admitted that even⁸ those philosophers
who write treatiscs on the contempt 01 glory are 1110111-
selves,⁸ neverthelesS, influenced by the love of praise3 ’
and, in fact, ¹’the best men are most attracted by glory.
Ι (10 1101 hesitate to confess to you that Ι myself⁸ desire
no other reward for my toils and dangers in your behalf
than the eternal heralding 01 my virtues

4. Wherefore, since Archias has done honor in his
verse to the achievements 01 the Roman peoplc and 01
your generals3 since he has promised ¹⁰to give an eternal
record 01 praise 1110 you in view 01 your recent perils3
and since he is 12possessed 01 such a genius that he is
courted by our most distinguished men, I entreat you,
gentlemen of the jury, to receive him under your pro
tection, so that he may seem to be relieved by your
humanity, rather than injured by your severity.
