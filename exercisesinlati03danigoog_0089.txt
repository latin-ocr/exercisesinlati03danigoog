This Series will contain those portions of the Latin
authors that are usually read in American schools and
colleges3 and to meet the growing demand for more
liberal courses such other portioris will be included as
are well fitted for classroom use, but which have hitherto
laoked suitable editions. In order to furnish permanent
editions of nniiorm merit the work is distributed among
a large number of special editors and the several editions
will be based for the most part upon approved German
editions.

While thus profiting by the valuable results of German
scholarship, which give the assurance of marked excel·
lence bo the Series, each editor will nevertheless verify
Δ ll the statements of the original, and add to and aller
them as much as may be necessary bo adapt his work to
’ohe needs of American students.

The text will be carefully revised‚ and will be followed
in a separate part of the book by a full commentary and
index.

The Series will also conbain elementary and supple-
mentary works prepared by competent scholars. Every
effort will be made bo give the books a neat and atbrao

tire appearance.
